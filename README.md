 ## Motivation

This project was developed to provide consumers on any device quick, consistent, and customised weather updates, addressing a practical need. Combining frontend design, REST API consumption, cloud data management, and user authentication, it also functions as a full-stack learning tool.

 Creating this app sought to deepen my knowledge in **.NET MAUI** and **MVVM architecture**.
 Search **real-time APIs** and create beautiful charts.
 - Implement secure **Firebase Authentication** and **cloud storage** 
 Deliver a quite user-centred and interactive mobile experience.
