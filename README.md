# Weather App

Designed with **.NET MAUI**, this modern cross-platform weather app, which runs on **Open-Meteo API** and **Firebase**. This app allows users to remain informed about forecasts and weather conditions.

 ## Motivation

This project was developed to provide users on any device quick, consistent, and customised weather updates, addressing a practical need. Combining cloud data management and user authentication, I wanted to create an app that helps users in their day-to-day life by providing quick access to reliable, location-based weather data — something useful whether you're commuting, traveling, or scheduling outdoor activities.

 Creating this app aims to:
 - Improve my knowledge in **.NET MAUI** and **MVVM architecture**.
 - Search **Real-time APIs** to make the app more authentic.
 - Implement secure **Firebase Authentication** and **cloud storage** 
 - Deliver a quite user-centred and interactive mobile experience.
